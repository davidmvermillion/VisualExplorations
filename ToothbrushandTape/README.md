# Toothbrushes and Scotch Tape
A tongue-in-cheek exploration of data science using toothbrushes and scotch tape. Inspired by Dr. Ferguson's [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenferguson_is-it-just-me-or-is-affiliate-marketing-becoming-activity-7109607461791100929-CL8M?). Couldn't find traditional clear office tape and didn't want to delve into it more, so focused on toothbrushes.

Contrived approximation dataset (low confidence) shows average household in the United States uses half the number of toothbrushes as fly in space per year.
